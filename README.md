# Week Omnistack #8 | Rocketseat
 - Development of an application using the stack *Node.js*, *ReactJS* e *React Native*


## App
 - The application to be developed will be similar to Tinder, but for developers;;
 - Developers will be registered through the Github user;
 - Data returned from a Github API request will be saved to the database;
 - It will be possible to like and dislike users;

 - Due to the architecture of the ** Node **, through a ** websocket **, communication will be made between the server and the frontend in real time;

## Configuration
  - configuration ** Express ** , a microframework that deals with routes, requests and responses;
  - ** nodemon ** configuration to monitor code changes and restart the server automatically when changes occur;
  - Creation of * Models * and * Controllers *;
  - Configuration of ** mongoose ** (ODM that uses Javascript syntax) to handle ** MongoDB **, a nonrelational database;
  - Using ** axes ** to handle external API requests.

## Web Socket
  - Configuration **socket.io**, library that abstracts from Node's standard websocket protocol and provides an easier way to work with it
