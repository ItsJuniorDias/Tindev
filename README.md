# Week Omnistack #8 | Rocketseat
 - Development of an application using the stack *Node.js*, *ReactJS* e *React Native*

## Backend

## App
 - The application to be developed will be similar to Tinder, but for developers;;
 - Developers will be registered through the Github user;
 - Data returned from a Github API request will be saved to the database;
 - It will be possible to like and dislike users;

 - Due to the architecture of the **Node**, through a **websocket**, communication will be made between the server and the frontend in real time;

## Configuration
  - Configuration **Express** , a microframework that deals with routes, requests and responses;
  - Configuration **nodemon** to monitor code changes and restart the server automatically when changes occur;
  - Creation of *Models* and *Controllers*;
  - Configuration of **mongoose** (ODM that uses Javascript syntax) to handle **MongoDB**, a nonrelational database;
  - Using **axes** to handle external API requests.

## Web Socket
  - Configuration **socket.io**, library that abstracts from Node's standard websocket protocol and provides an easier way to work with it
